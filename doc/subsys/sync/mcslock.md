# Mcslock

mcs locks are used frequently throughout Twan for synchronisation, mcs locks should be used for short, critical sections, as they busy wait. mcs locks in Twan come in two forms, mcslock, and mcslock_isr. mcslock does not disable interrupts during critical sections, however it does disable preemption once a critical section starts, and reenables preemption once the critical section is over. If the scheduler timer fires during critical section, it'll set a flag associated with the task so that it hands control back to the scheduler once it is in a state where it is preemptible again. mcslock_isr on the other hand disables interrupts once a critical section starts, and reenables it once it ends. the decision made to reenable preemption and interrupts is based on whether or not they were enabled before the critical section was entered, if they were enabled, then they will be reenabled.

## Configuration

---
```
TWANVISOR_PV_LOCKS
```

Enables paravirtualised mcs locks, when this is enabled, vcpus within TwanRTOS will block if their predecessor in the mcs locks waiting queue is not active, and will be unblocked once the lock has been handed to them. This is designed to battle the lock holder/waiter preemption problem.
